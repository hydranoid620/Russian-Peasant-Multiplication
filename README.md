# Russian-Peasant-Multiplication
Recursive and looping implementations of russian peasant multiplication done in C, Ada, and Fortran.

I've also included a Bash script called `time.sh` to time each implementation with various inputs.

# Compiling
`make` or `make` all to compile all three targets.

`make rp-f` to compile the Fortran implementaiton.

`make rp-a` to compile the Ada implementaiton.

`make rp-c` to compile the C implementaiton.

# Running
`rpmulti-f` to run the Fortran implementation. 

`rpmulti-a` to run the Ada implementation.

`rpmulti-c` to run the C implementation.
